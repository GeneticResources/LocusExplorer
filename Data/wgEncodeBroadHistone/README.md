### Description

Chemical modifications (e.g. methylation and acylation) to the histone proteins present in chromatin influence gene expression by changing how accessible the chromatin is to transcription. A specific modification of a specific histone protein is called a histone mark. This track shows the levels of enrichment of the H3K27Ac histone mark across the genome as determined by a ChIP-seq assay. The H3K27Ac histone mark is the acetylation of lysine 27 of the H3 histone protein, and it is thought to enhance transcription possibly by blocking the spread of the repressive histone mark H3K27Me3. Additional histone marks and other chromatin associated ChIP-seq data is available at the Broad Histone page.
