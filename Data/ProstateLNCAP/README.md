### **Functional annotation**

We used a number of publicly available prostate epithelia and PrCa ENCODE datasets of chromatin features to identify putative regulatory regions at each risk locus (14,52). The integration of chromatin bio-feature annotations with SNP positions was performed using FunciSNP (53). These datasets included LNCaP and RWPEI DNase I HS sites (GSE32970) ENCODE; PrEC DNase I HS sites (GSE29692) ENCODE; LNCaP CTCF ChIP-seq peaks (GSE33213) ENCODE; LNCaP H3K27ac and TCF7L2 (GSE51621) (14), H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 histone modification ChIP-seq peaks (GSE27823) (54); FoxA1 ChIP-seq peaks (GSE28264) (55); AR ChIP-seq peaks (56) and AR binding sites (GSE28219) (57); NKX3-1 ChIP-seq peaks (GSE28264) (55). We also used the highly conserved set of predicted targets of microRNA targeting (miRcode 11 June 2012 release) (58). To determine whether any of the putative functional SNPs potentially affect the binding of known transcription factors, position-specific frequency matrices were employed from Factorbook (14,59).
