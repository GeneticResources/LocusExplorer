## ENCODE DNase Clusters track files

### DNaseI Hypersensitivity Clusters in 125 cell types from ENCODE (V3)

Data file saved at `Data/wgEncodeRegDnaseClustered` as gzipped tabixed file.
Source data is downloaded from <a href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeRegDnaseClustered/" target="_blank">UCSC golden path</a>.


### Description

This track shows DNase hypersensitive areas assayed in a large collection of cell types by the ENCODE project. Regulatory regions in general, and promoters in particular, tend to be DNase-sensitive. Additional views of this data and additional documentation on the methods used to identify hypersensitive sites are available from the Uniform DNaseI HS page. The uniform peaks in that track are the basis for the clusters shown here, which combine data from the peaks of the different cell lines.

### Credits

This track shows data from the University of Washington and Duke ENCODE groups, with uniform processing by the ENCODE Analysis Working Group. The clustering was performed at UCSC. For additional credits and references, see the Uniform DNaseI HS page.
